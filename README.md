# Hi, I'm Lisa Terence! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently learning the front-end development and would probably sneak into the back-end.

## Requirements
(No special requirements)

## Recommended modules
Chrome browser

## Installation
Use your normally used browser to search for chrome. If you want, this link will directly lead you to the chrome webpage from where, they can install chrome.
[Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=FNES&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI34OXm4by_QIVkevtCh1nHgQPEAAYASAAEgIBNPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Configuration
If you are installing google chrome for this and the webpage still doesn't appear on chrome, you might want to set your default browser as chrome. For this: 
- Open chrome.

- It will lead you to the settings page of chrome and from there, go to default browser and click on make default

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
1. Is the website mobile friendly?
> No, the website is only for big screens like laptops or PCs. For mobiles or tablets though, not currently.

2. The CSS is not getting applied.
> The webpage was created while keeping chrome in mind. So, usage of chrome is recommended. If there is still a problem, please double check if the name of the CSS file is nehasharma1.css .

3. The images are not loading.
> If the images are not loading, please check if the file names in index.html and the the of the images match. For example, if the problem is image of Goddess Mohini, please check that in the file names, that image is named as mohini.png.

4. I can't submit my reviews. 
> That's because the review section doesn't lead to a page yet. I want to develop it into a comment section of sorts so that people can see and maybe edit their posted reviews anonymously. I will need time, effort and studies to execute that but at this stage, that is not completed yet.

## Documentation
1. Open the link and start interacting on the ongoing website I have made.

2. You can't submit a review yet but you can read the book and comment your reviews on wattpad itself.

3. I am going to add pdf files of the books too.
