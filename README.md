This is a website about Author Neha Sharma putting forward her books so that anyone who visits this site can go ahead and get directed to her books.

## Project Description
I have tried making a webpage which would allow users to post comments or reviews about my books they read or other information they might need with it. I have used pure HTML and CSS yet because I only need those but I will surely include javascript in the future.

# Hi, I'm Lisa Terence! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently learning the front-end development and would probably sneak into the back-end.

## Motivation
So, I started on a whim but I came across this amazing discord server called Syntax Study Group and they have helped a lot in this. I might have troubled them a lot with my questions. Among them, especially WingManUp06#2016, Rimtasvyras#9557, kindacatch#1629, Michal#0610 and ➳ᴹᴿメ 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘠𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦 亗#9156 among others have helped me a lot from the very start and they were the ones who would motivate me to complete my project.

Currently, I only know 's github profile, which is:  
[➳ᴹᴿメ 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘠𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦 亗#9156's profile](https://github.com/Rajasthanichora)  
But I will make sure to add others as I discover them.

## Build Status
The project is still in its budding stage because the developer, me, has not ventured into js (javascript) yet. That's why if you press the submit button, it would show you an error. I plan to make it like a comment section so that everyone can read your review.

## Tech or Framework used
No tech or framework is used. I have used pure CSS and HTML. However, I have used an svg element for the small arrow in the label element of the nav section.

## Features 
I started this webpage as an effort to tell everyone about my books and so that others can comment on them too. This would give bookworms like me a website where they can come, interact with other users, or read the reviews and see if they want to check that book or not. Besides that, it doesn't use google account or anything of the sort, because I am a noob developer and also because I think that will help keep anonymity. Probably I will try something in the future such that I will know which devices added which comments so that I can stop them from posting problematic content.

## Requirements
You might need to add a username for every review you post. If you are conversing with someone, this could be annoying so I will add some account formation thingy in the future after I will learn how to.

## Recommended modules
Chrome browser

## Installation
Use your normally used browser to search for chrome. If you want, this link will directly lead you to the chrome webpage from where, they can install chrome.  

[Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=FNES&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI34OXm4by_QIVkevtCh1nHgQPEAAYASAAEgIBNPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Configuration
If you are installing google chrome for this and the webpage still doesn't appear on chrome, you might want to set your default browser as chrome. For this: 
- Open chrome.  

![Chrome install step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Terencelisa/Wattpad/89656f33f7203757c5a0620e066f5431a73e6b7c/Chrome1.png)

- Click on the three dots at the upper right hand side corner of the page.  

![Chrome install step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Terencelisa/Wattpad/89656f33f7203757c5a0620e066f5431a73e6b7c/Chrome2.png)

- A dropdown menu will appear. Click on settings.  

![Chrome install step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Terencelisa/Wattpad/89656f33f7203757c5a0620e066f5431a73e6b7c/Chrome3.png)

- It will lead you to the settings page of chrome and from there, go to default browser and click on make default  

![Chrome install step 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Terencelisa/Wattpad/89656f33f7203757c5a0620e066f5431a73e6b7c/Chrome4.png)

## Troubleshooting & Frequently asked questions
1. Is the website mobile friendly?  
No, the website is only for big screens like laptops or PCs. For mobiles or tablets though, not currently.\\

2. The CSS is not getting applied.  
The webpage was created while keeping chrome in mind. So, usage of chrome is recommended. If there is still a problem, please double check if the name of the CSS file is nehasharma1.css.

3. The images are not loading.
If the images are not loading, please check if the file names in index.html and the the of the images match. For example, if the problem is image of Goddess Mohini, please check that in the file names, that image is named as mohini.png.

4. I can't submit my reviews. 
That's because the review section doesn't lead to a page yet. I want to develop it into a comment section of sorts so that people can see and maybe edit their posted reviews anonymously. I will need time, effort and studies to execute that but at this stage, that is not completed yet.

## Documentation
1. Open the link and start interacting on the ongoing website I have made.

2. You can't submit a review yet but you can read the book and comment your reviews on wattpad itself.

3. I am going to add pdf files of the books too.
 
4. I have just learnt HTML and know a limited amount of CSS. I intend to learn javascript next and I am open to suggestions or advices.
