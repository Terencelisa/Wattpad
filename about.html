            <h2>Hello everyone! Welcome To NehaSharma205!!</h2>
            <p>
                I made this website because I have just started coding and I was advised to make a
                website on ads. So, I thought, why not create a website showcasing my own books?
                Yes, the books in the website are written by me! People get surprised when they
                come to know this but it is easy really. You just have to get started and you 
                wouldn't even know when you are done with the book. So, if you write any books, 
                hit me up on wattpad and probably I will read the book and give you a review while
                you can read mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I use the pen name of Neha Sharma to write my books. That is not my real name 
                but you can still call me Neha and I would respond. I am from Mumbai and I
                believe that people outside as well as inside India are very ignorant about the 
                Indian culture. That is why, I have decided to write books which show my culture, 
                good and the bad and the possible reasons in my own way. I strive to educate 
                everyone on the Indian culture through the bookish media the way people understand 
                the American culture through the movie media (Hollywood).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this website, I will provide information about my ongoing and completed novels, 
                which I hope you would like. I am dedicating my time and efforts in writing these 
                books so I really hope you would enjoy them. There is a review section below every 
                book section and I would look forward to your reviews on my writing content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The books are currently free so that broke students like me can read the books too 
                because I know how much of a bummer it is when you can't keep reading something you 
                like BUT I want to remove my broke status too so if I do manage to grab myself 
                some good royalty program and get some much needed cash, I will surely update
                that on this webpage so that you won't read it halfway and be left hanging for 
                more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides all this professional stuff, it is nice meeting you all and thank you so 
                much for visiting this webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please do not advertise about your books in the review sections of this webpage. 
                That's not why I made this website. So, please refrain from talking about your own 
                books here. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! If you do, I won't hesitate to delete your 
                comments.
